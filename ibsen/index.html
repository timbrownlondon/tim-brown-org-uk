<h1>Ibsen</h1>
In 1983 I bought three volumes of a tweleve volume set of Henrik Ibsen's collected works.
I used them as sketchbooks developing my practice of working on printed text which I have contiuned for forty years.
<p>
Here are a selection of pages from these Ibsen plays. Most of these date from the 1980s.
