Tim Brown makes art that spans the handmade and the technological.
Based in London, he builds devices, writes software, and works with electronics while maintaining drawing and mark-making as the foundation of his practice.
<p>A graduate with distinction from Oxford University's Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Tim Brown's work addresses mortality and memory, language and digital culture, and the persistent recording of places and people. His work is represented in public and private collections in the UK.
