<p>The video shows the Sieve of Eratosthenes in action, a method for discovering primes numbers.</p>
<p>All numbers are first assumed to be prime and drawn in black, except the number one which is not prime and drawn in white.<br>
Then all those with factors are systematically eliminated.<br>
In the end...
<ul>
<li>Prime numbers remain black</li>
<li>Numbers with one prime factor are greeny yellow</li>
<li>Numbers with two prime factors are blue</li>
<li>Numbers with three prime factors are dark red</li>
<li>Numbers with four prime factors are grey</li>
</ul>
The number at the end of the spiral is 807 and is prime.</p>
<p>The palette is inspired by Jackson Pollock's <i>Shorthand Figure</i>, 1942</p>
